# `nixos-configs` / dotfiles

As I try out NixOS as my main OS, I'm having my NixOS configs take over my dotfiles. Format of repository inspired by https://github.com/Xe/nixos-configs.

Branches in this repository are timestamped "logs" of when I last reset my dotfiles. For example, if you go to the branch `2020-01-09`, you can see my dotfiles shortly before I reset them.
